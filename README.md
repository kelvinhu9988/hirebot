One of the main responsibilities of Human Resources is the task of screening candidates for a certain job. Nowadays, automated hiring systems have been widely used by the HR department. However, in most of the computerized hiring systems, the personality traits and the emotion process of job candidates as an important factor of consideration in recruitment are overlooked and rarely well analyzed. Therefore, I came up with the idea of building a conversational chatbot called HireBot by utilizing the technology of facial image processing and emotion detection. The goal of the chatbot is to output a well- rounded evaluation of job candidates' personality traits and emotion process.
